\begin{cvletter}

    I am an first year MSc. student in Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University
applying for the Bioinformatics internship.

I have experience with pipeline development from my undergraduate thesis.
I was designing an end-to-end pipeline to explore the relationship between rates of horizontal gene transfer and the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria. I wrote scripts to retrieve the data for all complete bacterial genomes on NCBI, produce gene and species trees for each species and preform network analysis. Since I was working with several thousand genomes my code was aslo efficient and produced clear simple organized outputs. This involved significant python, R, shell scripting and usage command-line tools like BLAST and Diamond. I also compiled my work into a publically available manuscript and presentation, explaining the background information, my methods and results for both technical and non-technical audiences.

I have more direct experience having worked at a start-up called Adapsyn helping direct biochemists with identifying natural products from microbes for potential drug development. This was general data analysis to see where the most relevant and interesting products were coming from and what microbial strains and growth conditions to focus on.

My formal education in Genetics and Molecular biology in my undergrad was complimented by my work and extracurricular experience writing code and working with biological data. I am now furthering my skills and knowledge by pursuing an MSc. in Computational Biology, shoring up my quantitative skills and gaining more experience with analyzing biological data. I am currently completing courses in Computational Genomics and Machine Learning, learning about various tools for NGS data analysis (QC, assembly, mapping etc.), how to prepare such data for ML tasks and how to go about implementing and testing a suite of different ML algorithms for binary classification among many other tasks.

I think my experience with programming and working with biological data as well as my educational background in genetics and bioinformatics make me an ideal candidate for this position.
